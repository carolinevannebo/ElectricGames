The game is noted for its steep learning curve, nonlinear gameplay, and emphasis on player preparation and exploration. Dark Souls was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in 2011, and has since been ported to Linux, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. A remastered version of the game, titled Dark Souls: Remastered, was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows in May 2018.
